The basic component package generated by the ROME packager will 
contain:

lib/  process_templates/  root/  sql/


If you have no requirements for your package, other than ROME, then
this will be fine. lib contains the Component Catalyst Controller module,
process_template contains all the process templates, root contains all the
view templates and sql contains all of the sql instructions to load the 
component, its processes, their accepted and created datatypes and their 
parameters into the database
