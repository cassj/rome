\subsubsection{AJAX and Javascript}
\label{sec:view_javascript}

\paragraph{}
ROME uses the scriptaculous effects toolkit and the prototype.js library on which it is built. The requisite javascript files are in \texttt{root/static/js/} and are loaded by the default header. The default header also loads the \texttt{rome.js} file which contains javascript functions used by the ROME core. For add-onn ROME components, necessary javascript for a page will automatically be loaded if it is placed in a file under the same path as the url to which it corresponds. 

\paragraph{}
The core \texttt{rome.js} file defines various generic functions which can be used by any page, such as a \texttt{select\_all} function for checkbox groups and functions for updating  page elements when something changes via an AJAX call, including \texttt{update\_nav} and \texttt{update\_status\_bar}.
