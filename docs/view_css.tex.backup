\subsubsection{Cascading Style Sheets}
\label{sec:view_css}

\paragraph{}
Cascading style sheets (CSS) are used to define the way in which elements of ROME pages are presented. The default file is in root/static/css/rome.css, though this can be overridden as required in skins. CSS files for add on components can be added under the css directory with a path that corresponds to the URL of the ROME page on which they are used. These will then be added automatically for that page by the default wrapper template.
