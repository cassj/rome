\subsubsection{Processes}
\label{sec:model_processes}
\paragraph{}
A single process corresponds to a single script template. The location of the template files is determined by the config file (\texttt{rome.yml}) \texttt{process\_templates} setting (by default the process\_templates directory in the ROME home directory). Each process is stored in the database in the \texttt{process} table. Processes belong to components and the primary key of the table is composed of the three columns \texttt{name, component_name} and \texttt{component_version} to reflect this.


and a brief description of the process, the name of the template file (relative to the template directory) and the appropriate processor class (relative to ROME::Processor::). Processes have associated \texttt{parameters} defined in the \texttt{parameter} table. Datatypes of the input datafiles this process expects and the datafiles this process produces are held in the \texttt{process\_accepts} and \texttt{process\_creates} tables.
% Parameter constraints are defined (when the process is installed) in the database \texttt{parameter\_constraint} table as perl subroutine references and serialized to the database using the Storable.pm freeze method.
