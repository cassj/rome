\subsubsection{Workgroups}
\label{sec:model_workgroups}

\paragraph{}
Workgroups are defined in the \texttt{workgroup} table. Any user can create a workgroup and by doing so become leader of that group with control over which other users can join. Users can share whole experiments and individual datafiles with workgroups to which they belong. Shared data can be viewed by other members of the group, but only the owner of the datafile or experiment (or administrators) can edit them.
