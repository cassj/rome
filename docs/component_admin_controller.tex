\paragraph{}
The component admin controller provides functionallity for installing and uninstalling non-core components. Components are provided as distributions as generated by the component creation controller. 

conditionally limiting access to components? Can't really do this with roles unless it's just at the interface level (we can hide them in the menu). You can't stop people just going to the URL. The ACL plugin would allow this, I think: eg. only allow access to anything under the foo/ path from people with the ExpertUser role?
