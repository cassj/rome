\subsubsection{Devel}
\label{sec:controller_devel}
\paragraph{}
The Devel component provides developer tools for generating new components and processes. All of the actions in this controller require the 'dev' role.

\paragraph{}
The devel/components and devel/datatypes actions forward page templates to the view. The various form methods are expected to be called via AJAX and pass the required form temlate on to the view. Most of the other actions provide functionality to creat, select, updat and delete components. Processes can be added to and deleted from the selected component. Datatypes a process accepts and creates can be added to and deleted from a process. Parameters can be added to a process via an uploaded HTML::FormFu configuration file. The process template file that will be used to generate the R script can be uploaded and checked against the values defined for accepted datatypes, created datatypes and parameters. 

\paragraph{}
The devel/component/distribution action generates a package file from the selected component (stored in the components folder of the ROME root directory) that is installable using the Admin controller described below.
