\subsubsection{Admin}
\label{sec:controller_admin}

\paragraph{}
The admin controller provides various support actions for a ROME administrator. All of the actions in this controller require the 'admin' role.

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
admin/
admin/component/select
admin/component/install_form
admin/component/install
admin/component/rollback_form
admin/component/rollback
admin/component/delete 
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

\paragraph{}
The index action passes the admin page template to the view. Installing components requires that the package file be uploaded into the admin upload directory in order that the install\_form can locate it. The installable package (as generated by the Devel controller) provides all the necessary files for the component and its processes and also all the necessary information to enter the component, process and datatypes into the ROME database. Deletion of a component will fail if any of its processes have been used to create extant datafiles or if there are any jobs queued for any of its processors. 

\paragraph{}
Components have version numbers. All installed component packages are backed up in the components directory so if a newly installed comopnent fails component/rollback provides the capacity to rollback to any of the versions of that component previously installed.
