\paragraph{}
The Devel component provides developer tools for generating new components and processes. All of the actions in this controller require the 'dev' role. It exists as a seperate, installable component and should not be installed in a deployed instance of ROME.

\paragraph{}
The controller for the Devel component is ROME::Controller::Devel. This controller provides the functionality to create, select, update and delete components. Processes can be added to and deleted from the selected component. Datatypes a process accepts and creates can be added to and deleted from a process. Parameters can be added to and deleted from a process and constraints defined for those parameters. The process template file that will be used to generate the R script can be uploaded and assigned to the component. For processes which require more complicated controller actions and view templates, the Devel component can be used to provide a skeleton structure that may be fleshed out by the developer.

The devel/component/distribution action generates a package file from the selected component (stored in the components folder of the ROME root directory) that is installable using the Admin controller.
