\section{Future Developments}

% Ignore this for now - am making notes as I think of them
% 
% \subsection{Updating}
% Automatic detection of new R and Bioconductor releases? Automated update procedure? Option to install and test with rollback to previous versions?
% 
% \subsection{Automated Installation}
% Need to write an install script which will ask the user appropriate questions and set everything up accordingly. Probaly need to look into make etc.
% 
% \subsection{Space limitations}
% for individual users and overall.
% 
% \subsection{datafiles}
% handing over ownership of shared datafiles if you delete your account,
% 
% \subsection{processors}
% Multiple types - converter components for datatypes between different processors? Management of workflows with multiple processors? Generic file format with parsers for each processor - probably more work than just writing export things for specific datatypes.
% 
% \subsection{rome\_process\_manager}
% Make sure the process\_manager can run on multiple machines and manages processor use more efficiently and so on.
