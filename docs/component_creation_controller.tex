\paragraph{}
The component creation controller is a developer tool and is only accessible to users with the 'devel' role. It provides functionality for automatically generating simple ROME components from uploaded R script templates (in template toolkit format). It also provides developers with the ability to package up their created components into distributions that may then be installed on other ROME instances.
