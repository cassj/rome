\subsubsection{Processors}
\label{sec:processors}
\paragraph{}
A processor is a perl module which can generate scripts at runtime from a template with user-defined / ROME-generated input and run that script. There is no database table for Processors, ROME automatically registers anything under the ROME::Processor:: namespace as an installed processor. Processors are discussed in more detail in the context of ROME Controllers in section \ref{sec:processors}.
